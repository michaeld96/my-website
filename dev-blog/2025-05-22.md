## Dependency Injection
Forgot how it worked when it came to .NET, but all we need to do is register the service
and then when we create our object .NET will use it's DI container to give us the external
dependencies we need. This is done with `builder.Services.AddScoped<Interface, Object>();`.

## RouteTemplate

In .NET, to have a request to hit your specific endpoint, you need the route template
which is just a string next to the attribute, like so

```cs
[HttpDelete({route}/{is}/{here})]
```
