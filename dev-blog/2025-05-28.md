## EF PK

When making a primary key using EF, just doing
```cs
public class Model
{
    public int ModelId { get; set; }
};
```
is enough to establish a PK.

## EF Navigation
When establishing FKs, and if it's not a one-to-one relationship, you may want "navigation" which
lets you talk about the object and the properties of that object. If you have a collection of 
these object, you can talk about specific properties of that object, rather than just the Id.
```cs
public class RefModel
{
    public int RefModel { get; set; }
    public int ModelId { get; set; } // FK. 
    public Model Model { get; set; } = null!; // Let's us access more information on the model besides the Id.
}
```

## Null Forgiving Operator
When we are getting compiler warnings about possible fields being null, we can quite these warnings
using the null forgiving operator. All you have to do is `null!`.
