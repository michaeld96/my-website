## Templated String

If you a string evaluated at render time, you can use a templated string.

To use this in JSX we need to use back ticks. 
```js
const isActive = true;
return <div className={`item ${isActive ? 'on' : 'off'}`}>Test</div>;
```

This is equivalent to:
```js
return <div className="item on">Test</div>;
```

## Classes and CSS

When we want to apply two or more classes to an element in HTML

```js
                    {schools.map((school) => (
                        <li
                        key={school}
                        className={`list-item ${school == selectedSchool ? 'active' : ''}`}
                        onClick={() => handleSchoolClick(school)}
                        >
                            {school}
                        </li>
                        ))}
```
the code above will set the class of this HTML tag to either `list-item` or `list-item active`. What `list-item active`
means is that it will look for the CSS that has both `list-item` and `active`, like below:

```css
.list-item.active
{
    background-color: #007BFF;
    color: white;
    border-radius: 4px;
}
```
