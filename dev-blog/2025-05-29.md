## `DbContext`

DbContext is used by EF to track the current state of modifications of 
records and what not and then save it to the actual database. There is one 
DbContext per database.

## `DbSet<T>`

DbSet represents a table in EF. We init this in the context like below.

```cs
public class Context : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Table1> Table1s { get; set; } = null!;
    public DbSet<Table2> Table2s { get; set; } = null!;
}
```
