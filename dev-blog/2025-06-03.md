# Seeding Data

For seeing data I need to do 
```cs
protected override void OnModelCreate(ModelBuilder b)
{
   base.OnModelCreat(b);
   b.Entity<T>.HasData( new T {/* your data */}})
}
```

This will seed the data when we type in dotnet ef migrations add <your-topic-here>.

# EF Workflow
1. Have EF generate a migration with SQL `INSERT` statements based on seed data.
```
dotnet ef migrations add <your-name-for-migration> -p <project-with-db-context> -s <start-up-projet>
```
2. Have the migration run and execute these `INSERT` statements, loading the data into the actual db.
```
dotnet ef database update <project-with-db-context> -s <start-up-projet>
```

# `protected`
Means that this method is accessable for this class and it's subclasses.

# Changing an existing model
If you cange you model you need to run
```
# 1. Create a new migration that captures your model changes
dotnet ef migrations add AddNewModelChanges -p Infrastructure -s API

# 2. Apply it to the database
dotnet ef database update -p Infrastructure -s API
``` 

# Odd error with past migrations and model changes
I made major model changes and apparently the migrations needs a linear histroy.
My past migrations were there and trying to apply to my new models, which
was not going to happen because the models were completly different.

So, I had to `dotnet ef database drop` to clear the database. Delete all the migration
files, and then add my new migrations and update the database. Then, my database was
hanging for whatever reason, so I just did `docker compose down -v` to clear the volumns
from that container, and now I have it working.
