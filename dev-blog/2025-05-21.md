## `async`
This means pause and resume without blocking the thread. This lets us do other things while waiting for the request.

With every `async` there is an `await`, this makes sure that the server is not locked up while we wait.

## Task

This is just an object that represents an ongoing or fture asynchonous operation.

## [FromBody]

`[FromBody]` Note content <- What this means is that we populate the C# object `Note` from the body of the payload.
```json
{
  "school": "GT",
  "subject": "CS 6200: Intro to Operating Systems",
  "title": "Overview",
  "content": "# Intro to Operating Systems\n\nThis is a test..."
}
```

an example payload above.

## To have a return type in TSX

Two ways
1. Arrow Functions
```js
const isSchoolSelected = (): boolean => {
  return selectedSchool !== null && selectedSchool !== '';
};
```
2. OG functions
```js
function isSchoolSelected(): boolean {
  return !!selectedSchool;
}
```
